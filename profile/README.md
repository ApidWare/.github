## About us - Introduction
## Q - 🧑‍💻 Who are we and what's our purpose?
### Who are we?
We are fellow developers, just like you.\
Commited towards one goal - to make technology free for all, transparent to all and private for all. (That's three TBH 😅)\
And to achieve this goal, we need developers like you. To contribute to ApidWare and help it reach new heights.

### The purpose.
The purpose is simple yet complex. To make a suite of mobile and web apps to fulfill everyone's daily needs. The sole purpose is to provide everyone better, free, private and open-source based suite of apps as a substitute to what they're already using.

## Q - 👀 What is the meaning of the tagline - Free. Private. Transparent. ?
The tagline specifies three of the main sole purposes of ApidWare -
### Freedom 🙌
- Freedom from censorship.
- Freedom to edit, view or reproduce* the source code anytime.
- Free for all. ApidWare never requires you ever to spend a single penny**.
### Privacy 🤞
- Private experience for users/devs as the whole suite of apps won't contain any type of shady tracking practices often done by some tech giants.
- ApidWare is determined to put the user's security and privacy at first. A secure and private experience for all.
### Transparancy 💪
- The whole source code is and will always be open-source and available to everyone.
- The whole development procedure will take place here, on [GitHub](https://github.com/ApidWare). Fully transparent.
